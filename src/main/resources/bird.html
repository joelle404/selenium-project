  <h1>About Birds</h1>
  <p>Birds are warm-blooded creatures with feathers, wings, and beaks. They are known for their ability to fly, though not all species are flight-capable.</p>
  <p>Birds communicate through a variety of sounds, such as chirps, songs, and calls. Each species has its unique vocalization, often used to attract mates or signal danger.</p>
  <p>Birds play important roles in ecosystems as pollinators and seed dispersers, contributing to biodiversity.</p>
